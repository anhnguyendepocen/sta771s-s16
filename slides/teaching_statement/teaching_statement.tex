\frametitle{Why write a teaching statement?}

\begin{itemize}

\item Faculty hiring and promotion/tenure processes require it

\item ``The act of taking time to consider one’s goals, actions, and vision provides an opportunity for development that can be personally and professionally enriching. Reviewing and revising former statements of teaching philosophy can help teachers to reflect on their growth and renew their dedication to the goals and values that they hold." - Nancy Van Note Chism, Professor of Education at IUPUI

\frametitle{Tips}

\begin{itemize}

\item Make it brief and well written (1-2 pages for hiring, 3-5 pages or more for promotion/tenure)

\item Use first-person narrative

\item Avoid cliches -- especially ones about how much passion you have for teaching

\item Be specific -- concrete examples to help reader visualize you in the classroom

\item Be discipline specific -- explain how you advance your field through teaching

\item Avoid jargon and technical terms, as they can be off-putting to some readers

\item Don't repeat your CV

\item Be humble -- mention students in an enthusiastic, not condescending way, and illustrate your willingness to learn from your students and colleagues

\item Revise -- teaching is an evolving, reflective process, and as you evolve as a teacher your teaching statement should evolve with you

\end{itemize}
