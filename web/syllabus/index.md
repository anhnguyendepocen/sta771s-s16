### Overview

This course is designed to help students become better teachers and 
communicators of statistics. Students will be introduced to 
innovative pedagogical approaches for teaching college level 
statistics, with an emphasis on introductory statistics education. 
Course will be divided into three units:

* **Unit 1 - Being a TA:** In this unit we will discuss best 
practices for being an effective TA such as tips for office hours, 
leading computing labs, grading student work and giving constructive 
feedback.
* **Unit 2 - Leading a class:** This unit is designed to prepare 
students for leading their own class such as course development, 
writing a syllabus, tips for lecturing, active learning, and 
integrating technology into the course. In this unit students will 
also be asked to give sample lectures and receive feedback. These 
will be video-taped so that students can evaluate themselves as well.
* **Unit 3 - Preparing for the next stage:** This unit will focus on 
writing teaching statements and giving talks in preparation for the 
academic job application and interview process.

The course will be based primarily on discussion, practice teaching, 
and feedback. 

The course counts as one of the two pedagogy courses required for 
the graduate schoolâ€™s [Certificate in College Teaching](https://gradschool.duke.edu/professional-development/programs/certificate-college-teaching).

### Email & Piazza

I will regularly send announcements by email, please make sure to 
check your email daily.

Any non-personal content-related questions should be posted on 
Piazza. Before posting a new question please make sure to check if 
a thread on your question exists. If so, pick up the discussion 
there. You should also answer each others' questions.

Note that one reason for using Piazza for course discussion is to 
teach you how you can use online discussion forums effectively in
your own teaching.

result in a 0 grade for all parties involved as well as being

final class grade. Please review the [Duke's Academic Dishonesty policies](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/z-policies/academic-dishonesty).


### Class attendance

Class attendance is a firm expectation; frequent absences or 
tardiness will be considered a legitimate cause for grade reduction. 
You must be in class on a day that you are scheduled to present, 
there are no make ups for presentations.


### Policies

other than coursework during class.
* Late work policy: -20% for each day late.
* Regrade requests must be made within one week of when the 
assignment is returned, and must be submitted in writing. These will 
be honored if points were tallied incorrectly, or if your answer is

the number of points deducted for a mistake. There will be no grade 
changes after the final exam.
