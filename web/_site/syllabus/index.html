    <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>This course is designed to help students become better teachers and 
communicators of statistics. Students will be introduced to 
innovative pedagogical approaches for teaching college level 
statistics, with an emphasis on introductory statistics education. 
Course will be divided into three units:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Unit 1 - Being a TA:</strong> In this unit we will discuss best 
practices for being an effective TA such as tips for office hours, 
leading computing labs, grading student work and giving constructive 
feedback.</li>
  <li><strong>Unit 2 - Leading a class:</strong> This unit is designed to prepare 
students for leading their own class such as course development, 
writing a syllabus, tips for lecturing, active learning, and 
integrating technology into the course. In this unit students will 
also be asked to give sample lectures and receive feedback. These 
will be video-taped so that students can evaluate themselves as well.</li>
  <li><strong>Unit 3 - Preparing for the next stage:</strong> This unit will focus on 
writing teaching statements and giving talks in preparation for the 
academic job application and interview process.</li>
</ul>

<p>The course will be based primarily on discussion, practice teaching, 
and feedback.</p>

<p>The course counts as one of the two pedagogy courses required for 
the graduate school’s <a href="https://gradschool.duke.edu/professional-development/programs/certificate-college-teaching">Certificate in College Teaching</a>.</p>
